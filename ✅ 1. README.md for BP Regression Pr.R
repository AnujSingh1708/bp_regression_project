# BP Regression Project

This project involves building a multiple linear regression model to understand the relationship between blood pressure (BP) and various predictors like age, cholesterol, and weight.

## 🔍 Objective

To predict blood pressure based on key health indicators and evaluate the model using diagnostic and performance metrics.

## 📊 Methodology

- Data Cleaning using `dplyr` and `janitor`
- Model Building using `lm()` and `tidymodels`
- Diagnostic Plots using `ggplot2` and `broom`
- Model metrics: Adjusted R², RMSE, AIC

## 📈 Results

- Coefficient Plot shows significant predictors
- Diagnostic plots indicate decent model assumptions
- Model interpretation is provided in code comments

## 🚀 How to Run

Open each script in RStudio and run in sequence:
1. `01_cleaning.R`
2. `02_model_building.R`
3. `03_diagnostics.R`

## 🛠️ Built With

- R
- tidymodels
- ggplot2
- broom
- janitor
